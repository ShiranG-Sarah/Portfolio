This project implemented a Monte Carlo simulation to simulate a profitability analysis based on net present value (NPV) of a proposed capital project.

This is what the user form looks like. For each textbox there's a default value bue you can still change it as you want.

This is just a demonstration of 5 different typical distributions used in Monte Carlo simulations and implement these into the VBA user form: 
1) The uniform distribution
2) The discrete distribution
3) The normal distribution
4) The triangular distribution
5) The Beta-PERT distribution
