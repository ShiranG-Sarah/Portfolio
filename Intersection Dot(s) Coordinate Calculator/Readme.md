This is a function that can calculate the coordinate(s) of intersection dot(s)of a circle and a straight line. Then save the text result into a txt file and a csv file. 

    There are three main parts in the project:
    •	Calculate the coordinates
    •	Convert the improper fraction to simplest form.
    •	Convert the square roots to simplest form.

    Sample results:
    There are two intersection points between (X-1)^2+(Y-9)^2=12^2 and 5X+0Y+1=0 . The coordnates of them are:
        A1['-1/5', '9+1√571/2']
        A2['-1/5', '9-1√571/2']

        There is no intersection point between (X-8)^2+(Y-2)^2=5^2 and 1X+1Y+1=0

        There is no intersection point between (X-0)^2+(Y-2)^2=8^2 and 1X+5Y+41=0

        There is only one intersection point between (X-1)^2+(Y-1)^2=1^2 and 1X+0Y+0=0 . The coordnate of it is:
        A['0', '1']

        There are two intersection points between (X-1)^2+(Y-9)^2=15^2 and 2X+0Y+0=0 . The coordnates of them are:
        A1['0', '9+4√14']
        A2['0', '9-4√14']
